# jazzyBot
A discord bot created using python.
This bot takes input from users which represent chords and will return a more jazzy option.
This means a maj7, min7, and dim chords.
Additional functionality like giving info on what the chord note composition is will be added.
It would be ideal to be able to add sounds for each of the notes added or even the sound of the chords but I do not know if that is possible yet.
